Within this section, you will notice `### BEGIN SOLUTION` and `### END SOLUTION` delimiters. When nbgrader creates the student version of the assignment, it will remove everything in these bounds and replace it with (by default) \n",

Within this section, you will notice `### BEGIN HIDDEN TESTS` and `### END HIDDEN TESTS` delimiters. Similarly to before, nbgrader will remove all code in this space when creating the student assignment, but it will not replace it with anything. Therefore, the only tests which the students will actually see are those which are outside of this area. Generally, it is reccommended to provide a few test cases visible to the student so that they may better understand the question.\n",
